In the field of finance, the task of portfolio optimization plays a crucial role in determining optimal asset allocation strategies that maximize returns while minimizing risks. In recent years, deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool in various domains for its ability to automatically learn complex patterns and representations from data. This paper aims to delve into the realm of deep learning in portfolio optimization and critically analyze the findings presented in the study [Deep Learning in Portfolio Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.13665). This research introduced an end-to-end framework that directly optimized portfolio weights using deep learning models, presenting promising results in terms of risk-adjusted returns measured by the Sharpe ratio. However, with the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic and its subsequent impact on financial markets, it becomes crucial to reassess and validate the performance of this model in a post-pandemic period.
