The problem of unemployment is a significant challenge for our organization and the wider US economy. High unemployment rates can lead to social and economic instability, as well as increased public spending on welfare programs. Therefore, understanding the factors that influence unemployment rates is crucial for developing effective policies to tackle this issue. Our projectâ€™s goal is to understand the impact of macroeconomic factors on the unemployment rate for men and women separately in the US. Specifically, we investigate how changes in factors like GDP, inflation, interest rates, wage, population, tax rate and CPI affect the unemployment rate for each gender.
